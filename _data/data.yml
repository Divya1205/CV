      - My academic journey includes a PhD from Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany and the Department of Biology, RWTH Aachen. This journey has been a blend of rigorous research in the use of ML/AI for protein-protein interaction applications and mentorship of pre-university students, especially during my tenure as a Group Leader at summer camps organized by miRcore, University of Michigan. My thesis defense is scheduled for 16, January, 2024.
      - I actively engage in international conferences and hackathons in the fields of application of AI/ML for bio-image analysis, drug discovery, and computational biomedicine. This engagement helps me stay connected with the latest in the field, constantly working on new and challenging problems, and networking with like-minded individuals. With a strong background in electronics and communications engineering, I bring a unique perspective to computational biology, constantly seeking innovative solutions to complex problems.
      - I have publications in renowned journals for the work done during my M. Tech. and PhD studies, as well as hackathons.

            - Helped students finish a research project within one week, while learning and applying new computational biology tools every day. 
            - In the CB camp, we researched genes of interest in Breast Cancer and answer questions related to the pathway, enrichment analysis of these genes with my group.
            - The tools and lectures in CB camp included [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/), [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ), Probability and Statistics, RNA expression and microarrays, GEOR, [GEO2R](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/), 
              [String-DB](https://string-db.org/ ), gene ontologies, gene regulation, enriched function and pathway analysis from [GO](https://geneontology.org/docs/go-enrichment-analysis/) and [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html ), looking at genes of interest in [gene cards](https://www.genecards.org/) and preliminaries of AI.
            - In the R camp, we identified Liver Cancer Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) biomarkers and categorized cancer samples using microRNA expression data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas).
            - We used the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package for data analysis, visualization and machine learning.
            
      - role: Group Leader

            - Supervised a group of 6 pre-university students in performing computational biomedicine research for one week in each camp.
            - In the CB camp, we researched genes of interest in Pancreatic Cancer and in the second CB camp, we researched Biomarkers in Multiple Sclerosis and we answered questions related to the pathway, enrichment analysis of these genes in my group.
            - The tools and lectures in CB camps are similar to the ones used in 2023 mircore CB camp mentioned above.
            - In the R camp, as in 2023 we identified Liver Cancer Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) biomarkers.
            - We studied important miRNAs marking the disease using a data table containing miRNAs and tumor samples control samples and we determined significant miRNA, using the smallest p values. 
            - We learned that LIHC is an aggressive form of cancer with a low chance of survival once the disease has progressed and ee found genes related to unregulated miRNAs including CDKs and RAS genes.
            - We used the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package for data analysis, visualization and machine learning using Random Forests.

      - role: PhD Researcher

            - The hot spots are key residues for protein- protein binding. Their identification may shed light on the impact of disease associated mutations on protein complexes and help design protein-protein interaction inhibitors for therapy
            - I developed a pipeline that reduces noise from biological data repositories using [Robust Principal component analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3599), then performs dimensionality reduction using [Extreme Gradient boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754). 
            - I applied this pipeline to the relevant data containing sequence and structure based features of protein-protein interation residues to get reduced data.
            - I then trained and validated ML classifiers on this reducded data and finally predicted hot spot residues on an independent test set to quantify the predictive power of my pipeline when used with ML classifiers.  
            - During my PhD studies I have participated in a plethora of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computational biology and Bioinformatics conferences, workshops and schools. 
            - I presented my poster in Summer School on Machine Learning in Drug Design at K. U. Leuven titled “Impact of Disease associated variants in the protein interactome at the human synapse” in August, 2018.
