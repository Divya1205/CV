career-profile:
    title: Career Summary
    summary: |
      - I am a dedicated researcher interested in applying ML/AI to computational biomedicine and drug discovery problems, currently focused on leveraging machine learning techniques for morphological profiling and cell painting at Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie in Berlin.
      - My academic journey includes a PhD from Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany and the Department of Biology, RWTH Aachen. This journey has been a blend of rigorous research in the use of ML/AI for protein-protein interaction applications and mentorship of pre-university students, especially during my tenure as a Group Leader at summer camps organized by miRcore, University of Michigan. My thesis defense is scheduled for 16, January, 2024.
      - I actively engage in international conferences and hackathons in the fields of application of AI/ML for bio-image analysis, drug discovery, and computational biomedicine. This engagement helps me stay connected with the latest in the field, constantly working on new and challenging problems, and networking with like-minded individuals. With a strong background in electronics and communications engineering, I bring a unique perspective to computational biology, constantly seeking innovative solutions to complex problems.
      - I have publications in renowned journals for the work done during my M. Tech. and PhD studies, as well as hackathons.

      - role: Researcher
        time: 01.04.2023 - Present
        company: Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany
        details: |
            - Phenotypic drug discovery through cell painting profiles using Machine Learning and AI.
            - Unsupervised learning and clustering to discover biological patterns and relevant Modes of Action data in cell painting data from two cell cancer lines, across multiple partner sites.
            - I am currently assisting my colleagues at Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie in publishing a morphological profiling dataset generated with the [EU-OPENSCREEN bioactive compound library](https://www.eu-openscreen.eu/services/compound-collection/european-chemical-biology-library-ecbl-pilot-library.html) and exploring the clusters in this cell painting data for further research prospects of this data for drug discovery.

      - role: Group Leader 
        time: 12.06.2023 - 14.07.2023
        company: miRcore (University of Michigan) 
        details: |
            - Group leader for virtual [Computational Biology (CB) Summer Camp](https://www.mircore.org/2023-cb-camp/) and [Machine Learning with R summer camp](https://www.mircore.org/2023-r-camp/).
            - Supervised a group of 6 pre-university students in performing computational biomedicine research for one week in each camp.
            - Helped students finish a research project within one week, while learning and applying new computational biology tools every day. 
            - In the CB camp, we researched genes of interest in Breast Cancer and answer questions related to the pathway, enrichment analysis of these genes with my group.
            - The tools and lectures in CB camp included [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/), [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ), Probability and Statistics, RNA expression and microarrays, GEOR, [GEO2R](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/), 
              [String-DB](https://string-db.org/ ), gene ontologies, gene regulation, enriched function and pathway analysis from [GO](https://geneontology.org/docs/go-enrichment-analysis/) and [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html ), looking at genes of interest in [gene cards](https://www.genecards.org/) and preliminaries of AI.
            - In the R camp, we identified Liver Cancer Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) biomarkers and categorized cancer samples using microRNA expression data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas).
            - We used the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package for data analysis, visualization and machine learning.

      - role: PhD Researcher
        time: 06.10.2017 - 31.03.2023
        company: Computational Biomedicine, Forschungszentrum Juelich and Department of Biology, RWTH Aachen, Germany
        details: |
            - My PhD thesis was titled: Machine learning methods for prediction of protein-protein interactions hotspot residues and my supervisors were [Prof. Dr Paolo Carloni](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/carloni_p), [Prof. Dr. Geraldine Zimmer-Bensch](https://epigenetik.rwth-aachen.de/prof-dr-geraldine-zimmer-bensch/).
            - The hot spots are key residues for protein- protein binding. Their identification may shed light on the impact of disease associated mutations on protein complexes and help design protein-protein interaction inhibitors for therapy
            - I developed a pipeline that reduces noise from biological data repositories using [Robust Principal component analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3599), then performs dimensionality reduction using [Extreme Gradient boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754). 
            - I applied this pipeline to the relevant data containing sequence and structure based features of protein-protein interation residues to get reduced data.
            - I then trained and validated ML classifiers on this reducded data and finally predicted hot spot residues on an independent test set to quantify the predictive power of my pipeline when used with ML classifiers.
